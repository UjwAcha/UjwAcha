Didn't expect this feature at all lol .

I can reply . as the script i am using to tweet just puts concatinates various files and makes a HTML file , i can basically put HTML code while tweeting and it'll work
<br>
and as i use iframes to put everthing together as well as properly saperated with abstractions i can do this
<br>
<a href="https://ujwacha.github.io/ujwacha/iframes/tweets/gonna-sleep.html">add a link to my previous tweet</a> and reply. others can do the same as well.
